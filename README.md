## Main Features
* Utilize text recognition to scan a receipt and load food items into the kitchen inventory on the app
* Manual input of an individual food item
* Prioritize food in your kitchen by expiration date
* Customize type of recipe recommendations by dietary restriction, preference or specific ingredients
* Recommended recipe for each food item
* Optimize as many food items in the kitchen for recommended recipe 
* Ability to create groups for sharing food items
* Share a food item among different groups

## Major Technology Decisions  
* We decided to use text-recognition/ receipt scanning to load food items, because it requires minual effort from users
* We chose Swift 3 as our main programming language because two of our developers have experience with it
* We chose Firebase as our back-end database because it has a free tier with well-written documentation and the ability to connect third-party authentication
* In order to process receipts and generate recipes in the background, several Firebase Cloud Functions are triggered to call the Yummly, Google URL Shortener, and OCRSpace APIs.
*  We chose Yummly because it allows recipe search by ingredient, and incorporates dietary preferences. It has a huge collection of over 1 million recipes.                                                                                      * We decided to use Facebook login for authentication because most people have an account already and it allows us to access an individualâ€™s friends list, which is useful for the sharing feature
